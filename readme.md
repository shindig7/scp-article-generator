# SCP Article Generator
### Author: Jonathan Law

This is my attempt to automatically generate SCP articles using machine learning; in particular, I'm currently using an LSTM to generate text based on the articles from SCP-002 to SCP-100.

The code is not completely mine; the model I'm using is the [Keras LSTM text generator example](https://keras.io/examples/lstm_text_generation/), slightly modified for my own purposes. The web crawler is my own creation, however.
